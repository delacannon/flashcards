-- Option 1: TEMPORARILY DISABLE RLS (for testing)
-- Uncomment these lines if you want to test without RLS first
-- ALTER TABLE flashcard_sets DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ALTER TABLE flashcards DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Option 2: SUPER SIMPLE POLICIES (Recommended)
-- These policies don't reference other tables at all

-- For flashcard_sets - only check user_id
CREATE POLICY "Users can do everything with their own sets"
  ON flashcard_sets
  FOR ALL
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- For flashcards - use a JOIN-free approach
-- We'll handle security in the application layer for flashcards
-- This allows all authenticated users to access flashcards
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read flashcards"
  ON flashcards FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert flashcards"
  ON flashcards FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update flashcards"
  ON flashcards FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete flashcards"
  ON flashcards FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Option 3: If the above still doesn't work, try this nuclear option
-- This creates a function that bypasses RLS internally
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_flashcard_sets()
RETURNS SETOF flashcard_sets
LANGUAGE sql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
STABLE
AS $$
  SELECT * FROM flashcard_sets WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
$$;

-- Grant execute permission to authenticated users
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_user_flashcard_sets() TO authenticated;
